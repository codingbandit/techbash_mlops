# Challenge 3: Trigger GitHub Actions with trunk-based development

Trunk-based development means that direct pushes to the main branch is prohibited. Code is to be created/modified solely on feature branches.

## Create a branch protection rule

1. In the GitHub repository, go to the **Settings** tab.
2. Under **Code and automation**, select **Branches**.
3. Choose to **Add rule**.
4. For Branch name pattern, enter `main`.
5. Check the checkboxes for **Require a pull request before merging** and **Require approvals**.
6. Select **Create**.

## Create Echo workflow that triggers on push to main

Create a new file `03-placeholder.yml` in the **.github\workflows** folder.

```yml
name: Challenge 3

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  dummyOutput:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Placeholder
        run: |
          echo "Will add code checks here in the next challenge"
```

## Create branch for new code, issue pull request, merge pull request

The person who submits the pull request can't be set to a reviewer, so for demo purposes use the override feature. Check the box next to "Merge without waiting for requirements to be met (bypass branch protections)" and merge the PR. Issue, review, merge all PRs in the GitHub repository web UI (on the Pull requests tab).

```bash
git checkout -b challenge3
git add .
git commit -m "Challenge 3"
git push --set-upstream origin challenge3
```

Note how merging is blocked until approved. Check teh box **Merge without waiting for requirements to be met** and merge the PR.

## Go to Actions tab and watch "placeholder" Challenge 3 action run

The action is set to automatically run on a push to the main branch. Check the actions tab and watch the workflow run.

The **dummyOutput** step should show the echo.
